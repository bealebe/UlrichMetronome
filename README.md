# UlrichMetronome

This is only a joke. It's meant to be the metronome that Lars Ulrich uses to practice his drumming...

Remember this is only a joke. I love Metallica, but I figured this would be a pretty fun little app to develop.

I also chose to do this in Kotlin, to get my feet wet in the language since I've never used it before. It is actually pretty easy to pick up. Oddly enough I found it to have similar extensions to the .NET library.
